# Peaches Lazy List Of Shit You Need
#### This is not a hardset checklist. Instead use this to figure out your own checklist and what you *need* to bring. Youtube is your friend and always always always ask if you have a question. Dumb shit gets people hurt all the time.

# 1. Shelter, Sleep, Bag.
These are the big three. You need a thing to sleep in/under, a thing to sleep in/on, and a thing to carry your shit to the place you're gonna sleep.

If you don't have a tent plan ahead and just coordinate who you're sharing a tent with. We can make it work I think. Sleeping pads/bags is a bit more touch and go. Still; communicate what:s up and we can get it handled.
itemized:
- backpack that won't hurt you
- sleeping setup. (bag/pad)
- shelter/tent

# 2. Water and Food
We'll be camped for two nights. The 2 miles hike in for the first night then a night and some more. Take what you feel is appropriate, we don't have *that* intense of a walk into camp but it's definitely not gonna be just a jog around the block. A good rule of thumb I hear get passed around is 
*2lb of food per day per head.* So do with that what you will. Try to pack your own grub as much as possible but i'm sure we'll still be doin hotdogs or something like that. Communicate.

However, whatever you do decide to bring make sure you're also deciding how you're gonna stash it. We don't have a choice; you will **need** to consider how we pack the food at night for bears. We can get into trouble if a ranger rolls up and we've just got food and garbage everywhere bcz that's how bears start realizing they can obliterate people to get at the box of fruit snacks. The camps do provide bear bag cables  already installed in trees and shit at site but not the bags themselves. Just make sure you're willing to either hang your bag with all odorous stuffs in it overnight or bring something that'll do the job overnight. Something stronger than a trash bag is really all.

Water is also important, arguably more, bring water bottle**s**. Yes plural. I personally suggest going to the store or amazon and buying a few of the smart water bottles that are atleast a liter in size. they sell a 1.5 liter bottle as well so if your pack can carry them you've got 3 liters of drinking water storage.

However you can't expect to carry all the water you'll need for 2 days in with you so you'll need to consider how you're gonna get it clean. Yes you can boil it, yeah we'll prolly have the stuff for boiling it, yes that's a pain in the ass and takes forever. i'm gonna be trying to bring a filter setup; i'd rec you do the same if you have it laying around or, like me, are retarded. You can get a sawyer mini squeeze setup w/all you really need for ~$25 on amazon I think.

No matter what though it's just smart thinking to carry redundancy for getting clean water and some water purification tablets are perfect for this i'd wager. Just remember where you stash them in your pack.

itemized
- Water bottles
- Water filtering setup (there's tons of ways that people do their water setup; as long as you can reliably turn dirty river water into drinking water)
- Food
- Stash sack/bear bag
# 3. Everything Else

Bug spray, sun screen, booze, controlled substances, everything else like that comes after getting your food/water and the big 3 handled. Once you cover everything before this you *should* be fine. You might have a really awkward and shitty experience, you might never wanna do this again, but you'll be safe and fed.

Some stuff you'll want to consider in no particular order...
* you're gonna need to take a shit. there's no bathrooms/portapotties. could you dig a hole with a rock? the heel of your shoe? a stick? sure. is that hole gonna suck and wash away your feces into the stream within the year? sure. buy a backpacking trowel for your cat holes. trust me.
* line your pack with a trash/compactor bag and then put your gear inside that bag to keep your shit dry
* bring socks. bring an extra pair of socks. dear god bring an extra pair of socks and keep them dry. lightweight but comfy clothes for sitting at camp wouldn't hurt as well
* food and water weigh the most out of anything in your pack usually. Try to keep that in mind as you decide what to bring and what you wanna leave behind
* BRING A *FUCKING* ***KNIFE***
	* *ahem*
		* #### ***BRING A FUCKING KNIFE***
* Walking stick/trekking poles are always nice
* expect it to be HUMID expect it to be HOT and expect the BUGS to be PROWLING FOR THAT ASS. I'm not expecting a super tick infested area but I am absolutely expecting MOSQUITOS. 
	* bring some off, bring some repellant lotion, do what you gotta do. if you really really really don't want bug bites on your face they make super cheat mosquito nets that you can just throw over a hat and keep em' off your face. amazon is the move 4 this one.
	* I also would suggest, if you find that you always get eaten alive no matter what you use bring some Cortizone-10 anti itch. trust me.
